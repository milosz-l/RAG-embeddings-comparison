# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) embeddings comparison

## Overview
This project explores the influence of various embeddings on the effectiveness of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Key Objectives
- Analyze the Retrieval Augmented Generation approach.
- Define embedding models to be compared.
- Define RAG evaluation methods.
- Evaluate the impact of diverse embeddings on the efficiency and accuracy of RAG.
- Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different embedding choices.
